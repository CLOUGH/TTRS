			<h4>What is TTRS?</h4>
			<p>The Transit Tracking and Routing System (TTRS), is a navigation system that uses  The Global Positioning 
			System (GPS), to get real time information on Jamaica's private and public transportation systems. TTRS allow 
			user to get real time and up-to-date information on vehicle routes,  estimated arrival time of next vehicle, estimated travel time, traffic information, and real time vehicle location and tracking information.</p>
			<p> TTRS was built to provide these services for the regular commuter in the urban areas such as
			Kingston, Portmore, Spanish Town, Montego Bay and connecting towns.</p>
			<p>The system relies our partnership with participating transportation companies and entities, to authorize the use of their tracking information. As a part of our partnership with participating companies and private entities we will provide both physical hardware for gathering tracking information and complementary software to make use of the data gathered.</p>
